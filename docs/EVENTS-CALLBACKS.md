A generally application involves in data entry from the users.
the below example takes the input from a form and upon submission will display the data.

```javascript
     <form>
        <input type="text" ref="name" />
        <button>Set Name</button>
    </form>
```
In the above we take a text input and using ```javascript ref ```  keyword of react we bridge the connection between inputs to the inner react layers.
